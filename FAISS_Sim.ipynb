       "'[{\\'text\\': \"CARTER, J.\\\\nThis is a proceeding in mandamus in which petitioner seeks to compel respondent, Secretary of State, to take the various steps required of him by law to prepare for submission to the electorate at the next appropriate election a measure to repeal article XXV of the Constitution which was added at the general election in November of 1948. (Article XXV provides for pensions for the needy aged and blind, and as will hereafter more fully appear, is commonly referred to as Proposition 4, that being its position on the election ballot in 1948.) Compliance has been had with all the steps necessary for the repeal measure concerning petitions for an initiative constitutional amendment. Petitioner is the official proponent of the repealing measure. Heretofore, the present opponents of the repeal measure and the former proponents of article XXV commenced a proceeding in the Superior Court of Sacramento County to obtain a writ of mandate ordering respondent here to refrain from submitting the repeal measure to the voters on the ground that it violates section lc, article IV of the Constitution of California, and other grounds.\\\\nThe opponents of the repeal measure, although not formally parties, appear here resisting the issuance of the writ as the parties “beneficially interested” and raise the same grounds as those upon which their proceedings is based in the superior court. The proponent of the repeal measure, though not a party in the latter proceeding, is actively participating therein. The same issues are thus presented in the proceeding here that are involved in the superior court action. The latter court issued an alternative writ of mandate in the proceeding before it, ordering respondent not to submit the repeal measure to the voters, or show cause why he has not so refrained, and that is the present status of the latter proceeding, the superior court not having as yet made its decision on the issuance of a peremptory writ.\\\\nIt is claimed that this court should not entertain this proceeding because of the pendency of the above mentioned proceeding in the superior court, although the two courts have concurrent jurisdiction in mandamus proceedings. The rule is stated in W. R. Grace & Co. v. California Emp. Com., 24 Cal.2d 720, 727 [151 P.2d 215]: “The writ [mandate] is therefore denied if a similar application between the same parties on the same matter is already pending before another court. (Goytino v. McAleer, supra; McMullen v. Glenn-Colusa Irr. Dist., 17 Cal.App.2d 696, 701-702 [62 P.2d 1083].) The pendency of another action, however, is no defense unless it is ‘between the same parties for the same cause.’ ” (See, also, Goytino v. McAleer, 4 Cal.App. 655 [88 P. 991]; McMullen v. Glenn-Colusa Irr. Dist., 17 Cal.App.2d 696 [62 P.2d 1083]; Millott v. Mare Island Emp. Assn., 44 Cal.App. 271 [186 P. 378]; Patterson v. City of Lynwood, 72 Cal.App. 212 [236 P. 933].) Assuming that the various technical requisites are present for a plea in abatement because of another action pending, it should be observed that such plea is dilatory in nature and not favored by the courts (Lincoln v. Superior Court, 22 Cal.2d 304 [139 P.2d 13]; Lord v. Garland, 27 Cal.2d 840 [168 P.2d 5]; 1 Cal.Jur. 24), and in the instant case there are circumstances which we believe require this court to make a determination in this proceeding, to deny the plea in abatement, and to call for the exercise by this court of its original jurisdiction. The measure presented is an initiative constitutional amendment. “The right of initiative is precious to the people and is one which the courts are zealous to preserve to the fullest tenable measure of spirit as well as letter.” (McFadden v. Jordan, 32 Cal.2d 330, 332 [196 P.2d 787].) To preserve the full spirit of the initiative the submission of issues to the voters should not become bogged down by lengthy litigation in the courts, especially where there is a strong temptation to commence proceedings in the superior court by the opponents of a measure to delay its presentation to the electorate. The measure requires a statewide election. That the issues involved under article XXV, and consequently the proposed repeal thereof, are of vital consequence in the state is manifest. They directly affect every taxpayer of the state, which, in effect, means practically every resident of the state. They are of prime concern to the aged needy and blind. Whether the repeal measure will go on the ballot in November, 1950 (the next general election), or at a special election prior thereto rests with the governor (Cal. Const., art. IV, § 1). The exercise by the chief executive of his discretion is obstructed by pending litigation. Until the litigation is settled, he is not in a position to freely exercise his discretion and this court should clear the way for action or nonaction by him. For all these reasons and under all these circumstances, proper public policy demands that this court entertain these proceedings. Similarly, we do not believe such cases as Patterson v. City of Lynwood, 72 Cal.App. 212 [236 P. 933], Keyston v. Banta-Carbona Irr. Dist., 19 Cal.App.2d 384 [65 P.2d 371], McMullen v. Glenn-Colusa Irr. Dist., 17 Cal.App.2d 696 [62 P.2d 1083], Millott v. Mare Island Emp. Assn., 44 Cal.App. 271 [186 P. 378], Baines v. Zemansky, 176 Cal. 369 [168 P. 565], and Brown v. Jernigan, 74 Cal.App. 524 [241 P. 108], should be controlling. Moreover, it should be observed that in all of those eases, except the Zemansky case, local or private, as distinguished from statewide, elections or affairs were involved. The end result in the Zemansky case was the issuance of the writ.\\\\nTurning to the merits of the case, it appears that the opponents of the repeal assert that the repealing measure is invalid for two reasons: (1) It embraces more than one subject inasmuch as it repeals article XXV of the Constitution, which, in turn, it is claimed, embraces more than one subject in violation of section lc of article IV of the Constitution; and (2) The title is defective.\\\\nSection lc reads: “Every constitutional amendment or statute proposed by the initiative shall relate to but one subject. No such amendment or statute shall hereafter be submitted to the electors if it embraces more than one subject, nor shall any such amendment or statute embracing more than one subject, hereafter submitted to or approved by the electors, become effective for any purpose.” Before\\'discussing the application of that provision in the instant case, it should be mentioned that probably a “one subject” requirement would not be passed upon by the court ordinarily in connection with a simple repeal measure for the reason that it might present a moot question. If the repeal measure was held bad for multitudinous subjects, the act it repealed would necessarily be faulty and would be nullified, for it would be subject to the same condemnation. If the repeal measure contained only one subject, then it would operate to nullify the repealed proposition. Thus, whichever way the court decided, the enactment sought to be repealed would be destroyed. Here we do not have the ordinary case, for the “one subject” requirement as to initiatives was placed in the Constitution at the same time article XXV, the measure sought to be repealed, was adopted. We are assuming here, therefore, that the “one subject” limitation is applicable to the repeal measure here involved.\\\\n\\' The problem of whether more than one subject is embraced within one legislative act is not new in this state. Although section lc has been newly added extending the requirement to initiative constitutional amendments, the Constitution for many years has required that “Every act shall embrace but one subject, which subject shall be expressed in its title.” (Cal. Const., art.TV, § 24.) The proper scope and application of that provision as to singleness of subject was elucidated, as the latest word on the subject, by this court in Evans v. Superior Court, 215 Cal. 58, 62 [8 P.2d 467], upholding the adoption of the Probate Code in a single enactment: “. . . we are of the view that the provision is not to receive a narrow or technical construction in all cases, but is to be construed liberally to uphold proper legislation, all parts of which are reasonably germane. (Heron v. Riley, 209 Cal. 507, 510 [289 P. 160].) The provision was not enacted to provide means for the overthrow of legitimate legislation. (McClure v. Riley, 198 Cal. 23, 26 [243 P. 429].) . . .\\\\n“Numerous provisions, having one general object, if fairly indicated in the title, may be united in one act. Provisions governing projects so related and interdependent as to constitute a single scheme may be properly included within a single act. (Barber v. Galloway, 195 Cal. 1, 3 [231 P. 34].) The legislature may insert in a single act all legislation germane to the general subject as expressed in its title and within the field of legislation suggested thereby. (Treat v. Los Angeles Gas Corp., 82 Cal.App. 610 [256 P. 447].) Provisions which are logically germane to the title of the act, and are included within its scope, may be united. The general purpose of a statute being declared, the details provided for its accomplishment will be regarded as necessary incidents. (Estate of Wellings, 192 Cal. 506, 519 [221 P. 628]; BuelJce v. Levenstadt, 190 Cal. 684, 687 [214 P. 42] ; and cases cited.) The language of this court in Robinson v. Kerrigan, 151 Cal. 40, 51 [121 Am.St.Rep. 90,12 Ann.Cas. 829, 90 P. 129], is especially applicable to this case at this point. A provision which conduces to the act, or which is auxiliary to and promotive of its main purpose, or has a necessary and natural connection with such purpose is germane within the rule. . . . Our conclusion, therefore, is that the newly enacted Probate Code does not embrace more than one subject. Its numerous provisions have one general object. The classification of these provisions, made by the code commission, and carried into the title of the act, is a ‘reasonably intelligent reference to the subject to which the legislation of the act is to be addressed’, which is all that is requisite.” (See, also, cases collected in 23 Cal.Jur. 646-650; 50 Am.Jur., Statutes, §§ 196-199.) When the scope and meaning of words or phrases in a statute have been repeatedly interpreted by the courts, there is some indication that the use of them in a subsequent statute in a similar setting carries with it a like construction. (City of Long Beach v. Payne, 3 Cal.2d 184 [44 P.2d 305].) There is nothing in the argument to the voters when section le of article IV was adopted contrary to such construction or the purposes underlying the ‘‘ one subject’ ’ limitation.\\\\nIt is manifest that the general subject of article XXV which it is proposed to repeal is aid to the needy aged and blind. That article sets forth the pension payments to be made, the requirements to be met by a prospective recipient, the officer selected by name to administer the act, and the like, all aimed at the machinery to carry out the main subject and wholly incidental to it. Opponents of the repeal measure refer to four different purposes and incidentally claim 18 in all, such as that the repeal of article XXV will result in giving the Legislature power to reduce the pension payments pro vided for in such article, giving the administration thereof to the counties instead of the state, imposing liability on relatives and raising the minimum age qualification. All those things obviously pertain to any plan—single subject—of aid to the needy aged and blind. They are merely administrative details.\\\\nSaid opponents further object, really repeating the argument with respect to subject, that the title and summary of the repeal measure prepared by the attorney general is faulty. The Constitution imposes upon the attorney general the duty of preparing “. . . a title, and summary of the chief purpose and points of said proposed measure ...” (Cal. Const., art. IV, § 1.) The proper application and scope of that provision has likewise been settled by this court. A title so prepared is presumed, sufficient, and doubts are to be resolved in favor of its sufficiency; a substantial compliance is sufficient and it need not contain a summary or index of the provisions of the measure or auxiliary and subsidiary matters. (California Teachers Assn. v. Collins, 1 Cal.2d 202 [34 P.2d 134]; Epperson v. Jordan, 12 Cal.2d 61 [82 P.2d 445]; Brown v. Jordan, 12 Cal.2d 75 [82 P.2d 450]; Vandeleur v. Jordan, 12 Cal.2d 71 [82 P.2d 455].)\\\\nThe title prepared for the repeal measure reads: “Aged and Blind Aid, Initiative Constitutional Amendment. Adds Article XXVII, repeals Article XXV, State Constitution. Reinstates plan of Old Age Security and Aid to Blind, and method of administration thereof, in existence prior to adoption of Article XXV, except that maximum aid payments are retained at present level of $75 per month for aged persons and $85 per month for blind persons, with participation by the State and the counties. Authorizes Legislature to increase or decrease amount of payments to aged and to blind, and otherwise to amend or repeal existing laws. ” It is clearly sufficient, especially in the light of the very recent enactment of the measure sought to be repealed. Among the things in the repeal measure which are claimed not to be embraced in the title are that it recalls a director of social welfare named by article XS^V, abolishes the welfare board thereby created, state administration of pensions, changes method of raising money to meet payments and amount of payments, and similar things. Obviously the repeal measure in the main goes back to the law as it existed prior to the adoption of article XXV, the chief feature of which is that the authority in the field of needy aged and blind relief is returned to the Legislature. The title ^JFquately covers these subjects. It states that the measure ■peals article XXV, which dealt with and which deals with ‘JLd Age Security and Aid to the Blind, and the administration thereof.” It states specifically that the Legislature is vested with authority in the field. We believe it adequately advised the signers of the petition of the general nature of the measure.\\\\nFor the foregoing reasons, it is ordered that a peremptory writ of mandate issue as prayed for.\\\\nGibson, C.

      "[{'text': \"Opinion\\nGAUT, J.\\n1. Introduction\\nPlaza Freeway Limited Partnership (plaintiff) and First Mountain Bank (defendant) are successors in interest to the original landlord and tenant of commercial real property under a 25-year lease agreement. The parties were unable to determine the termination date of the ground lease. Nevertheless, at the time of plaintiff’s purchase of the property, defendant signed and delivered an estoppel certificate which provided a lease termination date of October 31, 1998. The trial court found the date on the estoppel certificate incorrect, and instead decided that the termination date was June 30, 1999. The court concluded that, based on the June 1999 termination date and the terms of the original lease agreement, defendant’s exercise of its option to renew on January 26, 1998, was timely. Thus, the court found defendant in lawful possession of the property and not guilty of an unlawful detainer.\\nOn appeal, plaintiff claims the doctrine of “estoppel by contract,” as codified in Evidence Code section 622, requires that the facts contained in the estoppel certificate, including the termination date, are conclusively presumed to be true. Defendant contends the conclusive presumption is inapplicable because an estoppel certificate is not a written “instrument” under section 622.\\nBased on our analysis below, we conclude that the estoppel certificate was a written “instrument” within the meaning of section 622, and, therefore, defendant was bound by the representations contained therein. According to the October 31, 1998, termination date stated in the estoppel certificate, defendant’s attempt to exercise its option to renew was untimely. We reverse the trial court’s judgment that defendant was not guilty of an unlawful detainer.\\n2. Factual and Procedural History\\nPlaintiff and defendant are assignees of a 25-year lease that was executed on June 1, 1973. The subject property of the lease was part of a shopping center located in Big Bear, California. Under the lease, the original tenant was required to construct a building to house a Security Pacific National Bank. The lease provided as follows: “The term of this Lease shall be twenty-five (25) years; plus the partial month, if any, immediately following the commencement of the lease term. The lease term shall commence on the earlier of: (a) 180 days after Landlord has delivered the demised premises to Tenant ready for Tenant’s construction as provided in Article 11, hereafter, or (b) on the date Security Pacific National Bank opens for business on the demised premises.\\n“As soon as the date of commencement of the Lease term has been determined, the parties hereto shall execute and deliver to one another an appropriate addendum to this Lease setting forth said date of commencement.”\\nArticle 11 of the lease agreement provides: “Landlord shall, at its sole cost, within one hundred twenty (120) days after the execution of this Lease, deliver possession of the demised premises to Tenant at final grade and at 90 per cent [sic] compaction, ready for Tenant’s construction in all respects.”\\nAlthough a subsequent addendum to the lease was contemplated, none was found. Security Pacific National Bank opened for business on June 14, 1974.\\nIn 1992, plaintiff purchased the shopping center from Chartered Pension Real Estate Investors (Chartered), a successor in interest to the original landlord. During the transaction, Chartered required each tenant of the shopping center, including defendant, to sign and deliver an estoppel certificate that set forth the key terms of each lease, including the termination date. Defendant’s estoppel certificate provided that, “The term of this Lease commenced on November 1, 1973 and will expire on October 31, 1998.” After review by defendant’s highest officers, the chief financial officer, Hazel M. Hagy, signed the certificate without making any changes.\\nUnder the lease, defendant had three successive five-year options to renew. According to article 3 of the lease, the tenant was required to notify the landlord of its intent to renew 12 months before the expiration date of the initial 25-year term.\\nOn January 26, 1998, defendant’s chief financial officer, Hazel M. Hagy, sent plaintiff a letter expressing defendant’s intent to exercise its renewal option. Plaintiff rejected defendant’s request as untimely. Defendant sent a second notice, which explained its belief that the termination date was on March 29, 1999.\\nDefendant remained in possession of the premises on and after October 31, 1998. Plaintiff filed an unlawful detainer action against defendant.\\nAt the close of trial, the court explained that, based on the language of article 2 in the lease agreement, the original landlord and tenant had anticipated some delay prior to the delivery of the subject property. The court reasoned that the earliest possible termination date, albeit inconsistent with article 2, would have been May 31, 1998 (25 years from the date of execution), and the latest possible termination date would have been June 30, 1999 (25 years from the date the bank opened). The court further reasoned that the October 31, 1998, date, as noted in the estoppel certificate, would not have been consistent with the language of article 2. Additionally, the court found that plaintiff failed to demonstrate any detrimental reliance on the estoppel certificate based on the list of rents paid by the tenants of the shopping center, which indicated that defendant paid only 1.7 percent of the total rent revenue. The court concluded that, in accounting for a six-month delay for delivery and a six-month period before commencement, as provided under article 2, the lease had started on June 30, 1974, and ended on June 30, 1999, 25 years later. Therefore, the court found defendant in lawful possession of the property and not guilty of an unlawful detainer. The court also awarded defendant approximately $45,000 in attorneys’ fees and costs.\\n3. Discussion\\nOn appeal, independent review applies to a case involving only questions of law, such as the interpretation of statutes or contracts, and, therefore, this court is not bound by the trial court’s analysis and conclusions. (People v. Taylor (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1084, 1103 [8 Cal.Rptr.2d 439]; see also City of Manhattan Beach v. Superior Court (1996) 13 Cal.4th 232, 238 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 82, 914 P.2d 160].)\\nPlaintiff claims that defendant was estopped from contradicting the October 31, 1998, termination date on the estoppel certificate under section 622.\\nSection 622 provides, in relevant part: “The facts recited in a written instrument are conclusively presumed to be true as between the parties thereto, or their successors in interest . . . .” Defendant argues that the conclusive presumption contained in section 622 is inapplicable because the estoppel certificate did not constitute a written “instrument.” Based on our analysis below, we conclude that the estoppel certificate constituted a written “instrument,” within the meaning of section 622, and, consequently, defendant was estopped from contradicting the material terms contained therein.\\nIn an early case, Hoag v. Howard (1880) 55 Cal. 564, the California Supreme Court, in considering the provisions of the Civil Code, stated that the word “instrument” “will be invariably found to indicate some written paper or instrument signed and delivered by one person to another, transferring the title to or creating a lien on property, or giving a right to a debt or duty.” (Id. at p. 565.)\\nThe written paper or instrument need not represent an agreement. (Generes v. Justice Court (1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 678, 684 [165 Cal.Rptr. 222].) In Generes, the court clarified the misconstruction of the term, “written instrument,” by the court in People v. Fraser (1913) 23 Cal.App. 82 [137 P. 276]. In Fraser, the court wrote: “Generally the term ‘instrument’ as applied to documents necessarily imports a paper writing; but every paper writing is not necessarily an instrument within the settled statutory meaning of the term. With reference to writings the term ‘instrument’ as employed in our statutes has been defined to mean an agreement expressed in writing, signed, and delivered by one person to another, transferring the title to or creating a lien on real property, or giving a right to a debt or duty. [Citations.] This definition of the term as applied to writings contemplated, created, and controlled by various code provisions, has been repeatedly followed and applied in a variety of cases. Thus, for example, it has been held that a notice of lis pendens is not an instrument in the sense contemplated by our statutes [citation]; that a map is not an instrument within the meaning of the recording act [citation]; that neither an attachment nor a judgment is an instrument within the meaning of section 1107 of the Civil Code [citation], and that a notice of a claim of water-rights, although required to be recorded by section 1415 of the Civil Code, is not an instrument within the accepted definition of statutory instruments [citation].” (Id. at pp. 84-85, italics added.) Based on its interpretation, the court concluded that a birth certificate did not constitute an “instrument” within the meaning of Penal Code section 115. (Fraser, supra, 23 Cal.App. at p. 86.)\\nIn paraphrasing the definition of “instrument” set forth in Hoag v. Howard, supra, 55 Cal. 564, the Fraser court inserted the word “agreement.” In doing so, the court significantly narrowed the scope of qualifying documents. (Generes v. Justice Court, supra, 106 Cal.App.3d at p. 683.) Subsequent cases, including one cited by defendant, Rich v. Ervin (1948) 86 Cal.App.2d 386 [194 P.2d 809], repeated the Fraser court’s definition. The court in Generes observed: “Unfortunately, [Fraser], the appellate decision first employing the foregoing definition, distorted the sense of language in [Hoag v. Howard, supra, 55 Cal. 564], upon which it relied, and subsequent appellate decisions have uncritically accepted the limitations imposed by the Fraser definition. As a result, in those cases the term ‘instrument’ has been narrowly construed to exclude written documents that do not embrace an agreement, some of which undoubtedly would fall within a more generic definition of the term ‘instrument.’ [Citations.]” (Generes, supra, at p. 683.)\\nThe Generes court concluded that, “to qualify as an instrument within Penal Code section 115, a document need not represent an agreement; moreover it is not necessary that such a document be one that requires a delivery as a condition of validity.” (Generes v. Justice Court, supra, 106 Cal.App.3d at p. 684.) In applying its reasoning and legal conclusions to the facts in the case, the Generes court held that “a deed purporting to transfer an easement in real property from oneself to oneself is an instrument. . . .” (Ibid.)\\nAppellate decisions after Generes followed its analysis. (See, e.g., People v. Parks (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 883, 887 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 450] [temporary restraining order was an instrument]; People v. Tate (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 663, 667 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 206] [work referral forms, which reflected the number of hours a probationer worked on a service project, were “instruments” within the meaning of Pen. Code, § 115].) Indeed, even this court cited Generes in affirming convictions under Penal Code section 115 for filing false bail bonds. (People v. Garcia (1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 297, 306-307 [273 Cal.Rptr. 666].)\\nDefendant argues that Generes and the cases following Generes are inapposite because they involved the interpretation of the word “instrument” as used in Penal Code section 115. For the reasons below, this is a distinction without a difference.\\nIt is a well-established rule of statutory construction that, “[w]hen a word or phrase is repeated in a statute, it is normally presumed to have the same meaning throughout.” (People v. McCart (1982) 32 Cal.3d 338, 344 [185 Cal.Rptr. 284, 649 P.2d 926]; Hoag v. Howard, supra, 55 Cal. at p. 565.) Even in Fraser, the court noted: “The context of [section 115 of the Penal Code] does not indicate that the term ‘instrument’ as employed therein was intended to mean anything different in form and effect from the ‘instrument’ repeatedly referred to in numerous and various other sections of our code system. Nothing to the contrary appearing (either expressly or impliedly) from the language of the code section under discussion, it is inconceivable that the legislature intended that the word ‘instrument’ as used in that section should have any different or broader meaning than that uniformly contemplated by every other code section wherein the word is to be found. It must therefore be presumed that the word ‘instrument’ as used in section 115 of the Penal Code, is limited in its meaning and application to that class of instruments invariably referred to throughout our statutes. [Citations.]” (People v. Fraser, supra, 23 Cal.App. at p. 84.)\\nAlbeit in dicta, the court in Generes indicated that, in widening the perforations in the sieve created by Fraser’s definition, other documents would trickle out and qualify as instruments. (Generes v. Justice Court, supra, 106 Cal.App.3d at p. 683.) The examples noted by the court in Generes were a birth certificate (People v. Fraser, supra, 23 Cal.App. 82); a deposition (Jennings v. American President Lines (1943) 61 Cal.App.2d 417 [143 P.2d 349]); a homestead declaration (Rich v. Ervin, supra, 86 Cal.App.2d 386); dealer records from the Department of Motor Vehicles (People v. Wood (1958) 161 Cal.App.2d 24 [325 P.2d 1014]); a permit to issue securities (People v. Olf (1961) 195 Cal.App.2d 97 [15 Cal.Rptr. 390]); and a voter registration affidavit (People v. Fox (1977) 73 Cal.App.3d 178 [140 Cal.Rptr. 615]). We are not suggesting that all or any of these documents would qualify as instruments under Hoag v. Howard, supra, 55 Cal. 564. We are suggesting, however, that the Generes court, in its analysis of the term, did not differentiate between the word “instrument” as used in Penal Code section 115 and the use of the word elsewhere in the statutes.\\nWe find no reason to continue in the detour created by Fraser in adopting a definition of “instrument” that includes the requirement that the document must evidence an agreement. Fraser provides no justification for the inclusion of the term “agreement” in the definition of the word “instrument.” Furthermore, after the Generes court’s criticism of the definition in Fraser, no other published decision in California has relied on, or even cited, the Fraser case. In essence, Fraser, which involved Penal Code section 115, misconstrued the term “instrument” and Generes, which also involved the same criminal statute, clarified the confusion. Outside, as well as within, the context of Penal Code section 115, there is no basis for relying on the Fraser court’s inaccurate definition.\\nTherefore, while some agreements are evidenced by written instruments, not all written instruments reflect an agreement between the parties. In fact, in Generes, the court noted that the Hoag definition “obviously was not restricted to agreements since a conveyance of realty needs no consideration for its validity.” (Generes v. Justice Court, supra, 106 Cal.App.3d at p. 683, citing Civ. Code, § 1040.)\\nAs we will now discuss, the Hoag interpretation of the word “instrument” was not an exhaustive list of qualifying documents. This court’s cursory perusal of the Civil Code reveals the Legislature’s use of the word “instrument” was not limited to the categories established in Hoag. Rather, statutory references to the word “instrument” also support a commonsense or broader definition. (See, e.g., Civ. Code, §§ 843 [written instrument indicating, not only creating or giving, possessory rights or remedies of cotenants]; 987 [instrument waiving artist’s rights to protect work of fine art from defacement, mutilation, alteration, or destruction]; § 2337 [instrument intending to bind principal].) Webster’s Third New International Dictionary (1993) defines “instrument” as “a legal document (as a deed, will, bond, lease, agreement, mortgage, note, power of attorney, ticket on carrier, bill of lading, insurance policy, warrant, writ) evidencing legal rights or duties esp. of one party to another.” (Webster’s 3d New Intemat. Dict. (1993) p. 1172.) Although the Hoag definition would not encompass some of the documents listed in the dictionary definition above, the use of the word “instrument” in the broader sense in the statutes supports the conclusion that the Hoag definition is not an exhaustive list of all possible documents contemplated by the Legislature.\\nIn light of the foregoing, we turn to the specific statute at issue here. The conclusive presumption of section 622, formerly Code of Civil Procedure section 1962, subdivision 2, codifies the common law doctrine of “estoppel by contract.” (Estate of Wilson (1976) 64 Cal.App.3d 786, 801 [134 Cal.Rptr. 749].) Under section 622, “[t]he facts recited in a written instrument are conclusively presumed to be true as between the parties thereto, or their successors in interest . . . .” Although the word “instrument” as used in this section usually refers to a contract, we find the term also applies to estoppel certificates. In viewing an estoppel certificate as a binding confirmation of a lease agreement under section 622, while the departure from a contractual requirement is minimal, the impact on the reliability of commercial real estate transactions is significant. Furthermore, as a codicil to a will may reveal the most accurate intent of a testator (see Wilson, supra), an estoppel certificate reveals the present intent and understanding of the parties to a commercial lease agreement.\\n“An ‘estoppel certificate’ (or ‘offset statement’) is a signed certification of various matters with respect to a lease [citation]. An estoppel certificate binds the signatory to the statements made and estops that party from claiming to the contrary at a later time.” (Greenwald & Asimow, Cal. Practice Guide: Real Property Transactions (The Rutter Group 1999) ¶ 7.292, p. 7-73 (rev. #1 1997).) Black’s Law Dictionary defines “estoppel certificate” as “[a] signed statement by a party, such as a tenant or a mortgagee, certifying for the benefit of another party that a certain statement of facts is correct as of the date of the statement, such as that a lease exists, that there are no defaults and that rent is paid to a certain date. Delivery of the statement by the tenant prevents (estops) the tenant from later claiming a different state of facts.” (Black’s Law Diet. (6th ed. 1990) p. 551, col. 2.) By definition, an estoppel certificate is exactly the type of document to which application of section 622 would be appropriate.\\nIn Linden Partners v. Wilshire Linden Associates (1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 508 [73 Cal.Rptr.2d 708], the court addressed a situation similar to the one presented here. That case involved the sale and purchase of a medical office building for $22.2 million. The defendants owned the building. Wells Fargo Bank (Wells Fargo) leased space on the ground floor of the building. Bank Leumi (Leumi) subleased that space from Wells Fargo. Based on an agreement between the defendants and the prospective buyer, the plaintiffs, the defendants were obligated to furnish the plaintiffs with estoppel certificates signed by each tenant.\\nLeumi refused to sign an estoppel certificate. The appellate court colorfully noted that, “[t]he first willowy puffs of a storm cloud appeared when Wells Fargo also refused to sign an estoppel certificate for its subtenant.” (Linden Partners v. Wilshire Linden Associates, supra, 62 Cal.App.4th at p. 513.) Although the defendants provided the plaintiffs with copies of the lease and sublease, none of those documents indicated the amount of Leumi’s rent. Furthermore, although the sublease provided a formula for calculating the total rent, “[t]he key figure in the computation—the amount of operating expenses attributable to Wells Fargo to which the Leumi pro rata share was to be applied—was not shown.” (Id. at p. 514.) After being advised of how to calculate Leumi’s rent, the plaintiffs determined that the rent was $9,327.61 per month. “The storm clouds were gathering.” (Ibid.) Consistent with the plaintiffs’ calculation, the defendants signed and delivered an estoppel certificate on behalf of the tenant and subtenant, showing the total rent as $9,327.61.\\nAfter escrow closed, the plaintiffs received their first rent check from Leumi in the amount of $6,177.60. Apparently, the miscalculation, made by both parties, resulted from using the amount of Wells Fargo’s pro rata share of operating expenses from 1972, instead of 1982, as provided in the lease. When the defendants refused to make up the difference, a lawsuit ensued.\\nThe appellate court held that the defendants, by putting into escrow an estoppel certificate that incorrectly stated the amount of rent, breached the purchase agreement and thereby afforded the plaintiffs a right to seek damages. (Linden Partners v. Wilshire Linden Associates, supra, 62 Cal.App.4th at p. 531.) Although this case does not involve a buyer’s breach of a written contract cause of action against a seller, the analysis in Linden is relevant here.\\nIn this case, the tenant, not the seller, signed the estoppel certificate, attesting to the information contained therein. Paragraph 2 of the estoppel certificate provides: “The term of this Lease commenced on November 1, 1973 and will expire on October 31, 1998.” Above the date and signatures on the certificate is the following statement: “The foregoing certification is made with the knowledge that Purchaser is about to purchase the Property, that Lender is about to fund a loan on the Property, and that said parties are relying upon the representations herein made in making such purchase and funding said loan.”\\nPlaintiff and defendant were both bound by the ground lease, as assignees of the original landlord and tenant. Article 38 of the ground lease provides, in relevant part: “The Tenant shall without charge at any time and on a reasonable number of occasions within ten (10) days after written request of Landlord certify by written instrument in recordable form duly executed and acknowledged to any . . . purchaser ... as to the validity and force and effect of this Lease in accordance with its tenor, as to the existence of any default on the part of any party thereunder, as to the existence of any offsets, counterclaims or defenses thereto on the part of the Tenant and as to any other matters as may be reasonably requested by Landlord.” Article 33 states that, “[a]ll of the provisions of this Lease shall bind and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto, and their respective legal representatives, heirs, successors and assigns.” A reasonable interpretation of these provisions leads to the conclusion that defendant was required to provide a written instrument containing the above information, commonly referred to as an estoppel certificate. In signing and delivering the estoppel certificate, defendant is estopped from contradicting the facts, including the termination date, contained therein.\\nGenerally, the commencement and termination dates are necessary components of a lease agreement. (See 6 Miller & Starr, Cal. Real Estate (2d ed. 1989) Landlord and Tenant, § 18:26, p. 57.) In this case, where the exact termination date was unknown, the estoppel certificate served to set forth the key terms of the lease agreement, as understood by the tenant at the time of plaintiff’s purchase of the property. Even if the estoppel certificate contains an erroneous recitation of the lease terms, the facts contained in the certificate are conclusively presumed to be true under section 622.\\nEstoppel certificates are almost always used in commercial real estate transactions. They inform lenders and buyers of commercial property of the tenant’s understanding of the lease agreement. Lenders and buyers rely upon the certificates in finalizing loans and purchases. Thus, application of section 622 to estoppel certificates would promote certainty and reliability in commercial transactions. A contrary conclusion would defeat the purpose behind the widespread practice of using estoppel certificates.\\nFor the reasons provided above, we hold that, under section 622, when a tenant signs and delivers an estoppel certificate, as required under the commercial lease agreement, that tenant is bound to the recitations of fact contained therein. In this case, defendant is estopped from contradicting the termination date set forth in its estoppel certificate. Therefore, in failing to exercise its option to renew the ground lease within the one-year time period before the termination date of October 31, 1998, and in remaining on the premises after that date, defendant was guilty of unlawful detainer.\\n4. Disposition\\nWe reverse the trial court’s judgment that defendant was in lawful possession of the subject property. Based on this ruling, we also reverse the trial court’s award of attorneys’ fees. Plaintiff shall recover its costs on appeal.\\nRamirez, P. J., and Richli, J., concurred.\\nAll further section references will be to the Evidence Code unles's otherwise stated.\\nBecause this issue is dispositive, no further discussion of alternate issues is necessary.\\nIn support of the June 1999 termination date, Michael Leseney, a former corporate officer involved in the development of the subject property, testified concerning documents prepared in 1981, 1983, and 1987 that included the June 1999 date. Plaintiff was unaware of these documents because it purchased the property in 1992. In fact, Dennis Shollenburg, the president of First Mountain Bank, testified that while he had never informed plaintiff of the June 1999 date, he had sent two letters to plaintiff that indicated the October 1998 termination date.\\nPenal Code section 115, subdivision (a) provides: “Every person who knowingly procures or offers any false or forged instrument to be filed, registered, or recorded in any public office within this state, which instrument, if genuine, might be filed, registered, or recorded under any law of this state or of the United States, is guilty of a felony.”\\nThe Fraser court may have used the term “agreement” to avoid using the word “instrument” in defining the word “instrument.” The court in Hoag stated: “If we look into the provisions of the Code in which the word ‘instrument’ is used, it will be invariably found to indicate some written paper or instrument signed and delivered by one person to another, transferring the title to or creating a lien on property, or giving a right to a debt or duty.” (Hoag v. Howard, supra, 55 Cal. at p. 565, italics added.) It is possible that the Hoag definition is really no definition at all. Rather, when the court conducted a thorough evaluation of the Civil Code, it noted that when the word “instrument” was used, the types of documents the term generally referred to were those that transferred title, created a lien on property, or gave a right to a debt or duty.\\nThe Washington Supreme Court, in State v. Price (1980) 94 Wash.2d 810 [620 P.2d 994], cited Fraser for California’s definition of the word “instrument.” After comparing definitions used in other states, the court noted that “ ‘the term instrument is not one susceptible to an exact, precise and inelastic definition. It is employed in many different contexts in our law and its meaning shifts, sometimes subtly, sometimes not, depending on the context .... While in all cases the term serves to identify a class of paper writings, the type of document sought to be included in, or for that matter excluded from, the scope of a particular statutory enactment varies with the purpose that enactment seeks to serve. . . .”’ (Id. at p. 998.)\\nObviously, when the Legislature uses the word “instrument” to indicate a tool or object, such references do not comport with Hoag’s definition. (See, e.g., Civ. Code, §§ 847, 1791, 1882.3.)\\nAgain, in Hoag, the court held that a writ or judgment did not constitute an instrument. (Hoag v. Howard, supra, 55 Cal. at p. 566.)\\nIn Sanders Construction Co. v. San Joaquin First Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. (1982) 136 Cal.App.3d 387 [186 Cal.Rptr. 218], the court concluded that the parties’ joint execution and delivery of a “ ‘Notice and Acknowledgment of Lease Assignment’ ” bound the tenant under section 622. (136 Cal.App.3d at p. 395.) The notice contained|the following statement: “ ‘As tenants under the above referenced Lease, we hereby acknowledge that said Lease is in full force and effect, that we have no rental offsets, claims or defenses tot he enforcement of the Lease . . . .’” (Ibid.) Although, the court did not provide any analysis for this conclusion, it appears the court assumed that such written instruments were exactly the type of documents to which section 622 would apply.\\nThe facts in this case are clearly distinguishable from the facts in Aspeitia v. California Trust Co. (1958) 158 Cal.App.2d 150 [322 P.2d 265], There, the court held that the signing and delivery of an offset statement did not give an otherwise invalid contract validity. (Id. at p. 155.) Rather, this case is similar to Linden Partners, where the seller was bound by the estoppel certificate, despite the erroneous recitation of the monthly rent. (Linden Partners v. Wilshire Linden Associates, supra, 62 Cal.App.4th at p. 531.)\\nNotably, the court’s finding that the termination date was on June 30, 1999, was also in error according to the terms of the ground lease. Under articles 2 and 11 of the ground lease, the commencement date occurred, at maximum, 10 months after execution of the ground lease. Thus, under article 2, the commencement date was the earlier of April 1, 1974, at the latest, or June 14, 1974, the date the bank opened. Clearly, the court was wrong in using the date the bank opened to determine the commencement date. Based on this faulty premise, the court concluded that the termination date was on June 30, 1999. Failure by the parties and the court to determine the correct commencement and termination dates supports our conclusions that estoppel certificates provide reliability in commercial real estate transactions.\\nContrary to defendant’s argument, when the conclusive presumption in section 622 applies, a party does not need to demonstrate detrimental reliance.\", 'type': 'majority', 'author': 'GAUT, J.'}]\n",

      "[{'text': 'Opinion\\nWISEMAN, J.\\nThe 2000 voter initiative known as Proposition 36 requires courts to place those convicted of nonviolent drug possession offenses on probation and in drug treatment programs and prohibits them from incarcerating these offenders. (Pen. Code, §§ 1210, 1210.1.) In this appeal, we address whether the juvenile court’s failure to apply Proposition 36 to a minor violated the equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution or article I, section 7 of the California Constitution. We conclude that it did not because minors adjudged in violation of nonviolent drug possession offenses are not similarly situated to adults convicted of these offenses with respect to the legitimate purposes of the law. We also hold that the trial court properly stated the maximum term of confinement to be one year and four months under Welfare and Institutions Code section 726, subdivision (c). In the unpublished portion of this opinion, we determine that the trial court properly denied the minor’s motion to suppress evidence.\\nPROCEDURAL HISTORY\\nOn January 27, 2003, the People filed a juvenile wardship petition alleging that appellant Jose Z. (the minor) committed a misdemeanor violation of Health and Safety Code section 11550, subdivision (a), being under the influence of methamphetamine. The minor filed a motion based on the Fourth Amendment to suppress the evidence, which was denied. Subsequently, the minor admitted the allegations in the petition. While advising the minor of the consequences of his waiver of his right to a trial, the court stated that the maximum period of incarceration, if any, would be one year for the drug offense plus four months for a misdemeanor battery he had committed in 2001 and for which he had been on probation when he committed the drug offense.\\nThe court conducted a disposition hearing on April 1, 2003. Observing that the minor had previously been adjudged a ward of the court (for the battery), the court readjudged him a ward and committed him to the Kings County Bravo Boot Camp Program for not less than 150 days and not more than one year. The court again stated that the maximum confinement time was one year and four months.\\nThe minor appeals from the denial of the motion to suppress and the disposition imposed.\\nFACTUAL HISTORY\\nA. The battery\\nOn December 11, 2001, the minor, then age 15, joined with two other students at Liberty Middle School in attacking and beating Robert Y., another student. Later the same day, the three attackers and the victim were together in a program known as Opportunity Class. When the teacher briefly left the classroom, the three again attacked Robert. Robert’s mother called the police, and Robert reported to the responding officer that the three attackers said they beat him because he had to be “jumped into” Opportunity Class. The police officer observed bruises on Robert’s back, abdomen, and shoulders. When the officer contacted the minor, the minor admitted he had participated in the attacks.\\nOn February 8, 2002, the People filed a juvenile wardship petition based on these facts. The petition alleged a violation of Penal Code section 243.2, subdivision (a), battery on school property. The probation report revealed that the minor was arrested twice before for the same offense, on May 29, 2000 and May 3, 2001. The first incident was disposed of with a warning; for the second, the minor served 16 hours in a work program. At a court appearance on March 12, 2002, the minor admitted the allegations in the petition. In addition, the probation report reflected that the minor admitted he occasionally used alcohol and marijuana and had associates and relatives who were Sureños gang members. He denied he was a member himself.\\nAt the disposition hearing on April 22, 2002, the juvenile court adjudged the minor a ward and ordered him to serve 90 days in the Kings County Alpha Boot Camp Program. He served 79 days and was released on July 21, 2002. The minor remained on probation after his release, the court having placed him under the probation department’s supervision, with a one-year review set for April 22, 2003.\\nB. The drug offense\\nAt 1:00 o’clock in the morning on October 20, 2002, three months after his release from boot camp, the minor was riding in a pickup truck with three other young men. A deputy sheriff observed that there was a beaded necklace five to six inches long hanging from the rear-view mirror. Believing this to be a potential violation of Vehicle Code section 26708, subdivision (a), the deputy pulled the track over. The cab of the truck contained beer bottles, open beer cans, and a loaded rifle. The deputy observed that the minor exhibited signs of intoxication, and the minor admitted to the deputy he had used methamphetamine. A blood sample taken from the minor prior to booking tested positive for methamphetamine. The deputy also found a glass pipe in the minor’s pocket, which the minor stated he had used to smoke methamphetamine. Two rocks later proved to be methamphetamine were found under the seat of the patrol car in which the minor had been placed along with one of his companions. All four told the deputy that they were Sureños gang members.\\nAs noted above, the wardship petition on the drag charge was filed on January 27, 2003. On March 26, 2003, the minor was cited a fourth time for fighting on school grounds. He was also seen waving a blue bandanna in front of his school. Blue is the color of the Surenos gang.\\nDISCUSSION\\nI. Application of Proposition 36 to minors tried in juvenile court\\nProposition 36 added sections 1210, 1210.1, and 3063.1 to the Penal Code. (Prop. 36, approved Nov. 7, 2000, eff. July 1, 2001.) Section 1210.1, subdivision (a), of the Penal Code provides: “Notwithstanding any other provision of law, and except as provided in subdivision (b), any person convicted of a nonviolent drag possession offense shall receive probation. As a condition of probation the court shall require participation in and completion of an appropriate drug treatment program .... A court may not impose incarceration as an additional condition of probation.” The term “nonviolent drug possession offense” includes the offense the minor was found to have committed, being under the influence of a controlled substance in violation of Health and Safety Code section 11550. (Pen. Code, § 1210, subd. (a).)\\nAs can be seen, the statutory language only refers to those convicted, not those found to be offenders by a juvenile court, and the court did not apply Proposition 36 to the minor. The minor argues that the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and article I, section 7 of the California Constitution, require juvenile courts to apply Proposition 36 to minors found to have committed offenses within its scope. As a result, he concludes the court could not properly commit him to boot camp. On the other hand, the People argue that minors found in violation and adults convicted are not similarly situated for purposes of equal protection analysis. Further, the distinction the law makes would withstand equal protection scrutiny even if they were similarly situated.\\nAs a threshold matter, we dispose of an argument the People make which, if correct, would enable us to avoid deciding this constitutional question. The People point out that when the court sustained the wardship petition on the drug charge and committed the minor to boot camp, the minor was on probation for a nondrug offense, i.e., battery on school property. Citing People v. Esparza (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 691 [132 Cal.Rptr.2d 377], the People argue that even if the minor had been an adult convicted of being under the influence of a controlled substance, the court would have had the power to incarcerate him because he had violated probation imposed for a non-drug-related offense.\\nIn Esparza, the defendant was on probation for felony vandalism when he pled guilty to possessing methamphetamine. The trial court revoked probation on the vandalism charge and imposed a previously suspended three-year sentence. The court also denied probation for the drug charge and sentenced the defendant to eight months for that offense, consecutive to the three-year sentence. On appeal, the defendant argued that he should not have received prison time for either offense because the probation violation that precipitated the imposition of both sentences was a nonviolent drug possession offense within the scope of Proposition 36. (People v. Esparza, supra, 107 Cal.App.4th at pp. 694—695.)\\nThe appellate court affirmed the sentences. It held that the court had the power to revoke probation and sentence the defendant to prison on the vandalism charge because Proposition 36 does not apply to drug related probation violations where the underlying offense is not drug related. (People v. Esparza, supra, 107 Cal.App.4th at pp. 697-698.) Then, noting that Proposition 36 makes ineligible any drug program that is housed in a jail or prison, the court held that the court had the power to sentence the defendant to prison on the drug charge. The court reasoned that while in prison on the vandalism charge, the defendant would be unavailable to begin a Proposition 36 drug treatment program within the statutorily specified time period. (Id. at pp. 698-699.)\\nHere, the People argue that an adult in the minor’s situation could have been incarcerated despite Proposition 36 because he violated probation imposed for a non-drug-related offense, just as did the defendant in Esparza. Therefore, there is no difference between the court’s treatment of the minor and the treatment an adult charged with the same offenses could have received. If this argument were correct, there would be no need to reach the equal protection issue.\\nThe argument is unconvincing for two reasons. First, we cannot determine from the record whether any portion of the minor’s 150-day-to-one-year boot camp commitment was for the underlying offense of battery. On the contrary, the transcript of the disposition hearing tends to indicate that the commitment was only for the drug offense since the battery is not mentioned at all. Consequently, we cannot conclude that the minor was committed for an offense outside the scope of Proposition 36.\\nSecond, even if we reached this conclusion, we could not say the commitment for that offense would make the minor unavailable for a Proposition 36 treatment program because he was committed to a juvenile facility, not a jail or prison. The statute provides that eligible drug treatment programs “[do] not include drug treatment programs offered in a prison or jail facility,” but it does not exclude programs at juvenile facilities. (Pen. Code, § 1210, subd. (b).) Thus, neither of the reasons for declining to apply Proposition 36 that the court relied on in Esparza applies here. As a result, we proceed to consider the constitutional issue.\\nThe right to equal protection of the laws is guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and by article I, section 7 of the California Constitution. The federal and state provisions are analyzed in essentially the same manner. (In re Demergian (1989) 48 Cal.3d 284, 291-292 [256 Cal.Rptr. 392, 768 P.2d 1069]; People v. Leng (1999) 71 Cal.App.4th 1, 11 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 433].) The right “is essentially a direction that all persons similarly situated should be treated alike” by state actors. (Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc. (1985) 473 U.S. 432, 439 [87 L.Ed.2d 313, 105 S.Ct. 3249].)\\nIn the first stage of an equal protection analysis, we determine whether the state has adopted a classification that affects similarly situated groups of people in an unequal manner. (People v. Massie (1998) 19 Cal.4th 550, 571 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 816, 967 P.2d 29].) The analysis will not proceed beyond this stage if the groups at issue are not “ ‘similarly situated with respect to the legitimate purpose of the law,’ ” or if they are similarly situated, but receive “ ‘like treatment.’ ” Identical treatment is not required. (Darces v. Woods (1984) 35 Cal.3d 871, 885 [201 Cal.Rptr. 807, 679 P.2d 458]; People v. Hubbart (2001) 88 Cal.App.4th 1202, 1216-1217 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 490].)\\nIn this case, we conclude there is no violation of equal protection principles. The two groups at issue—“person[s] convicted of a nonviolent drug possession offense” in the words of Proposition 36, on the one hand, and persons adjudicated to have committed such an offense in juvenile court on the other —are not similarly situated with respect to the purposes of the law. It is true, as the minor argues, that Proposition 36 seeks to rehabilitate those convicted of the subject offenses, just as the juvenile court law seeks to rehabilitate minors adjudged to be offenders in juvenile court. But the two groups are not similarly situated with respect to this common purpose.\\nIn preserving juvenile court judges’ discretion to incarcerate nonviolent juvenile drug offenders, while removing superior court judges’ discretion to incarcerate nonviolent adult drug offenders, the law addresses itself to liberty interests that are qualitatively different. The California Supreme Court discussed this difference in In re Eric J. (1979) 25 Cal.3d 522 [159 Cal.Rptr. 317, 601 P.2d 549]. In that case, the question was whether a maximum term of three years for a minor found by the juvenile court to have committed a burglary violated equal protection principles, when the maximum sentence for an adult convicted of the same offense was two years. In holding that there was no equal protection violation because minors adjudicated in violation and adults convicted of burglary are not similarly situated, the court explained: “For purposes of this discussion, the most significant difference between minors and adults is that ‘[t]he liberty interest of a minor is qualitatively different than that of an adult, being subject both to reasonable regulation by the state to an extent not permissible with adults [citations], and to an even greater extent to the control of the minor’s parents unless “it appears that the parental decisions will jeopardize the health or safety of the child or have a potential for significant social burdens.” [Citation.]’ [Citation.] When the minor must be removed from the custody of his parents for his own welfare or for the safety and protection of the public [citation], the state assuming the parents’ role, the state also assumes the parents’ authority to limit the minor’s freedom of action.” (In re Eric J., supra, 25 Cal.3d at p. 530; see also In re Roger S. (1977) 19 Cal.3d 921 [141 Cal.Rptr. 298, 569 P.2d 1286] [no violation of equal protection principles in involuntary commitment of minor to state mental hospital at parent’s request, despite absence of findings that would be required for involuntary commitment of adult].) Here, the court removed the minor from his parents’ custody and committed him to boot camp for purposes of rehabilitation. It did not violate equal protection principles in doing so because the minor’s youth limits the scope of his liberty interest in that he may be confined for his own wel fare and for the safety and protection of the public.\\nThe differing liberty interests the court described in Eric J. correspond to different needs of minors and adults, and these in turn relate to different means of rehabilitation provided by the law. Proposition 36 drug treatment programs include “outpatient treatment, half-way house treatment, narcotic replacement therapy, drug education or prevention courses and/or limited inpatient or residential drug treatment as needed to address special detoxification or relapse situations or severe dependence.” (Pen. Code, § 1210, subd. (b).) These resources are considerable, but their rehabilitative purpose is different from that of the resources of the juvenile system. The juvenile court law provides, in part, regarding its purposes: “The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the protection and safety of the public and each minor under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court and to preserve and strengthen the minor’s family ties whenever possible, removing the minor from the custody of his or her parents only when necessary for his or her welfare or for the safety and protection of the public. . . . When the minor is removed from his or her own family, it is the purpose of this chapter to secure for the minor custody, care, and discipline as nearly as possible equivalent to that which should have been given by his or her parents. This chapter shall be liberally construed to carry out these purposes.” (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 202, subd. (a), italics added.) The state’s ability to exercise the same power as a parent to limit the liberty of a minor who becomes a ward of the court is consistent with the state’s responsibility to provide “custody, care and discipline” like that which should have been provided by the minor’s parents. Equal protection principles do not prevent the state from taking on, with respect to minors, responsibilities that it does not have for adults. For example, the federal and state constitutions do not forbid the state to “secure for [a] minor custody, care and discipline as nearly as possible equivalent to that which should have been given by his or her parents.” (Ibid.) This is especially true where, as here, the court finds that the custody, care and discipline will involve confinement—even though an adult would not be incarcerated for similar conduct.\\nIn sum, the needs of adult and minor drug offenders are not the same. Quoting Justice Frankfurter, the California Supreme Court has observed that “ ‘[t]he Constitution does not require things which are different in fact... to be treated in law as though they were the same.’ [Citation.]” (In re Eric J., supra, 25 Cal.3d at p. 530, fn. 1.) We hold that not extending the benefits of Proposition 36 to minors does not violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, or article I, section 7 of the California Constitution.\\nII. Maximum term of confinement\\nAs noted earlier, the court stated in its commitment order that the maximum term of confinement would be one year and four months. The court’s comments at the time the minor admitted the allegations in the petition indicate that one year was for the drug offense and four months was for the battery:\\n“THE COURT: Okay. It’s one year on this offense [the drug offense, violation of Health and Safety Code section 11550]. It looks like he had a misdemeanor battery too, a 243.2 in April of 2000. [][]... [][] In that case, it looks like it was a one-year misdemeanor.\\n“[The Deputy District Attorney]: That would be a one-year misdemeanor if he was convicted, so that would add four months.”\\nThe addition of four months for the battery was pursuant to Penal Code section 1170.1, which provides that a felony sentence ordered to run consecutively to another sentence shall be one-third of the middle term imposed for the offense. This squares with the holding in In re Eric J., supra, 25 Cal.3d at page 537, that avoidance of absurd results requires a similar sentencing scheme for felonies and misdemeanors. Consequently, since the maximum sentence for a violation of Penal Code section 243.2 is one year, the maximum consecutive term for this offense would be one-third of that period, or four months.\\nThe court included the maximum term of confinement in its order pursuant to subdivision (c) of section 726 of the Welfare and Institutions Code, which provided:\\n“In any case in which the minor is removed from the physical custody of his or her parent or guardian as the result of an order of wardship made pursuant to [Welfare and Institutions Code] Section 602, the order shall specify that the minor may not be held in physical confinement for a period in excess of the maximum term of imprisonment which could be imposed upon an adult convicted of the offense or offenses which brought or continued the minor under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court. [][] . . . [f]\\n“If the charged offense is a misdemeanor or a felony not included within the scope of Section 1170 of the Penal Code, the ‘maximum term of imprisonment’ is the longest term of imprisonment prescribed by law.”\\nThe minor argues that the court erred in two respects by ordering a maximum confinement time of one year and four months. First, he contends that, because an adult convicted of the same offenses would not, under Proposition 36, have received any time for the drug charge, the inclusion of time in his case violated equal protection principles. We reject this argument because, as explained earlier, there was no equal protection violation since the minor was differently situated from an adult convicted of the same nonviolent drug possession offense.\\nSecond, the minor takes the position that the stated maximum confinement time of one year and four months violated the plain language of Welfare and Institutions Code section 726, subdivision (c): “[T]he order shall specify that the minor may not be held in physical confinement for a period in excess of the maximum term of imprisonment which could be imposed upon an adult convicted of the offense or offenses . . . .” The minor argues that under Proposition 36, an adult convicted of violating Health and Safety Code section 11550 would not receive additional time. As a result, he reasons that, under Welfare and Institutions Code section 726, he should not either.\\nWe disagree. The foundational premise upon which the minor builds his argument is faulty since it is not true that under Proposition 36 the maximum term of incarceration for an adult violator of Health and Safety Code section 11550 is zero. On the contrary, the sentence must be “not less than 90 days or more than one year in a county jail.” (Health & Saf. Code, § 11550, subd. (a).) Under some circumstances, the diversion provisions of Proposition 36 do not apply: for example, the defendant was previously convicted of a violent felony (Pen. Code, § 1210.1, subd. (b)(1)); the defendant was convicted of a non-drug-related offense and a nonviolent drug possession offense in the same proceeding (Pen. Code, § 1210.1, subd. (b)(2)); the defendant used a firearm while committing certain drug offenses (Pen. Code, § 1210.1, subd. (b)(3)); the defendant refuses drug treatment (Pen. Code, § 1210.1, subd. (b)(4)); or the defendant is found to be unamenable to drug treatment (Pen. Code, § 1210.1, subd. (b)(5)). Under other circumstances covered by Proposition 36, probation may be revoked and sentence imposed, including when the defendant is found to be unamenable to drug treatment (Pen. Code, § 1210.1, subd. (c)(2)); the defendant commits a non-drug-related probation violation (Pen. Code, § 1210.1, subd. (e)(1)); or the defendant commits a drug-related probation violation and certain other circumstances exist (Pen. Code, § 1210.1, subd. (e)(3)). Under all these situations, the maximum one-year term may be imposed on an adult offender.\\nSince a term of up to one year remains available under Proposition 36 for a violation of Health and Safety Code section 11550, we interpret Welfare and Institutions Code section 726 as allowing a one-year maximum period of confinement. For misdemeanors and felonies not included within Penal Code section 1170, Welfare and Institutions Code section 726 provides that “the ‘maximum term of imprisonment’ is the longest term of imprisonment prescribed by law.” (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 726, subd. (c).) Here, the law simply states that the longest term prescribed for the offense is to be set forth in the juvenile court’s order as the maximum term of confinement. The longest term for a violation of Health and Safety Code section 11550 is one year. Thus, the plain language of the statute supports the court’s action. “If there is no ambiguity in the language” of a statute we undertake to interpret, then “we presume the Legislature meant what it said, and the plain meaning of the statute governs.” (Hunt v. Superior Court (1999) 21 Cal.4th 984, 1000 [90 Cal.Rptr.2d 236, 987 P.2d 705].)\\nIn an abundance of caution, we observe that even if Welfare and Institutions Code section 726 was ambiguous, we would still reach the same conclusion. “[W]e consider portions of a statute in the context of the entire statute and statutory scheme of which it is a part, giving significance to every word, phrase, sentence, and part of an act in pursuance of the legislative purpose.” (Curle v. Superior Court (2001) 24 Cal.4th 1057, 1063 [103 Cal.Rptr.2d 751, 16 P.3d 166].) Courts “should construe every statute with reference to the entire scheme of law of which it is part so that the whole may be harmonized and retain effectiveness.” (Clean Air Constituency v. California State Air Resources Bd. (1974) 11 Cal.3d 801, 814 [114 Cal.Rptr. 577, 523 P.2d 617].)\\nSection 726 also contains a provision defining “maximum term of imprisonment” for felonies within the scope of the sentencing provisions of Penal Code section 1170: “ ‘[M]aximum term of imprisonment’ means the longest of the three time periods set forth in paragraph [3] of subdivision (a) of Section 1170 of the Penal Code, but without the need to follow the provisions of subdivision (b) of Section 1170 of the Penal Code or to consider time for good behavior or participation pursuant to Sections 2930, 2931, and 2932 of the Penal Code, plus enhancements which must be proven if pled.” (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 726, subd. (c).) The referenced provisions of Penal Code section 1170 provide that where the statute gives the trial court a choice of three terms, the court shall impose the middle term unless it makes findings of mitigation or aggravation to support imposition of the lower or upper term. (Pen. Code, § 1170, subds. (a)(3) & (b).) Welfare and Institutions Code section 726 thus allows the juvenile court to state a maximum term of confinement based on the upper term, but without finding aggravation. In enacting this provision, the Legislature specified that the maximum term of imprisonment to be stated in the juvenile court’s order for felonies within Penal Code section 1170 is simply the maximum sentence available under any circumstances.\\nObviously, misdemeanor statutes do not contain three separate sentencing options as do Penal Code section 1170 felony statutes. As a result, under Welfare and Institutions Code section 726, in misdemeanors (like here) and non-Penal Code section 1170 felonies, the “maximum term of imprisonment” is nothing more than the longest term available.\\nWe conclude that under Welfare and Institutions Code section 726, the juvenile court must specify that the maximum term of confinement for the misdemeanor is the longest potential sentence set forth in the statute defining the offense. Further, this may be done without referring to the circumstances that would have to exist before that sentence could be imposed on an adult offender. For these reasons, the court did not err in setting one year and four months as the maximum term of confinement for the two offenses committed by the minor.\\nIII. Motion to suppress evidence\\nDISPOSITION\\nThe judgment is affirmed.\\nDibiaso, Acting P. J., and Gomes, J., concurred.\\nAppellant’s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied June 9, 2004.\\nThe rule is different for parole violators. Penal Code section 3063.1, added by Proposition 36, provides that “parole may not be suspended or revoked for commission of a nonviolent drug possession offense or for violating any drug-related condition of parole.” This applies even if the underlying offense is not drug related. There is no comparable provision benefiting probation violators. (See People v. Esparza, supra, 107 Cal.App.4th at p. 697, fn. 5.)\\nIt is important to make this distinction, rather than referring to the two groups simply as adults and minors. This is because a minor committed to the Youth Authority after being tried and convicted as an adult may well be entitled to the same sentencing treatment as an adult under the guarantee of equal protection. (See People v. Olivas (1976) 17 Cal.3d 236 [131 Cal.Rptr. 55, 551 P.2d 375] [misdemeanant between the ages of 16 and 21 tried as adult and convicted may not be committed to the California Youth Authority for a term potentially longer than the longest term that can be imposed on a person over 21].) Further, Proposition 36 expressly covers “any person convicted of a nonviolent drug possession offense,” and thus by its terms includes minors tried and convicted as adults. (Pen. Code, § 1210.1, subd. (a), italics added.)\\nNotably, in In re Eric J., supra, 25 Cal.3d 522, the court held that there is no equal protection violation in allowing the juvenile court to disregard the requirement of an aggravation finding.\\nSee footnote, ante, page 953.', 'type': 'majority', 'author': 'WISEMAN, J.'}]\n",

      "[{'text': 'LANGDON, J.\\nThis is an appeal by the defendant from a judgment in favor of the plaintiff in an action brought to quiet title to certain bars of gold bullion in the possession of the United States Mint at San Francisco. The plaintiff is the assignee of the interests of three corpora tions: Central Eureka Mining Co., Kennedy Mining & Milling Co. and Argonaut Mining Co., all of which own and operate gold mines in Amador County, near Jackson.\\nAppellant insists that the record does not contain sufficient evidence to support the judgment. However, a careful study of the testimony satisfies us that the judgment should be affirmed.\\nThe relevant evidence consists chiefly of admissions of the defendant. Joseph T. Murphy, district attorney of Nye County, Nevada, testified that the defendant had stated to him that he had purchased the gold “from miners working the mines, the Argonaut, the Kennedy and the Central Eureka Mines in the vicinity of Jackson, Amador county, California.” Leonard Schmidt, an agent of the United States Secret Service, testified that the defendant made a similar statement to him, and also that the defendant told him that he knew the gold was “high-graded.” The expression “high-graded” is commonly used and understood among miners to mean the theft of ores from the mine. (Atolia Min. Co. v. Industrial Acc. Com., 175 Cal. 691 [167 Pac. 148].) The defendant himself, in a sworn statement which was admitted into evidence, stated that he had purchased the gold “from miners working in the vicinity of Jackson, California,” and further, that “Affiant has reason to believe that the gold bullion purchased in Jackson, Amador county, California . . . came from the mines in the vicinity of Jackson, Amador county, California, namely the Argonaut, Kennedy and Central Eureka; that affiant is without sufficient information at this time to state definitely or accurately the precise amount of the said gold bullion that came from any of the particular mines mentioned, or that it all came from the said mines.” There was testimony, also, to show that none of the corporations had ever sold or given gold to any miners, and that such thefts were common.\\nDefendant urges that this sworn statement was inadmissible because it was not an admission of something which he knew of his own knowledge, but was itself based on mere hearsay. In this connection he cites the case of Tofanelli v. United States, 28 Fed. (2d) 581, where, in a trial for conspiracy to defraud the United States by depositing stolen ore in the mint, certain admissions of defendants were held to be based on hearsay and to be insufficient to support a verdict of guilty. The distinction between civil and criminal cases with respect to the quantum of proof is, of course, well settled; and the issue in the case at bar is the ownership of the gold, irrespective of what persons might have been concerned with the theft of it.\\nAdmitting, however, that certain parts of the defendant’s sworn statement are mere expressions of opinion, and perhaps based on hearsay, he did, on several occasions, state positively that he had purchased the gold from miners working in the Argonaut, the Kennedy and the Central Eureka mines. When this is considered in connection with the testimony that no ore was ever sold to miners, and that thefts of ore were common, it cannot be said that the lower court had no evidence upon which it might reach the conclusion that the gold was stolen from the mines of the plaintiff’s assignors.\\nThere are no other questions involved upon the appeal and the judgment is affirmed.\\nCurtis, J., Seawell, J., Richards, J., Waste, C.

      "[{'text': \"SHAW, J.\\nThis is an action to correct a mistake in a deed executed by the plaintiffs to the defendant. The plaintiff Redondo Improvement Company was merely a nominal party to the deed as well as to this action. In mentioning the plaintiff in this opinion we refer only to the railroad company.\\nThe mistake alleged to have been made consisted of the failure to insert in the description of the property an exception which, if inserted, would have excluded from the description certain territory otherwise embraced within the lines of a tract described in the deed by metes and bounds. The court found that the mistake was made as alleged, and gave judgment for the reformation of the deed as prayed for. The principal contention upon the appeals, which are taken from the judgment and from the order denying a new trial, is that the evidence does not sustain the finding or judgment.\\nIn July, 1901, the plaintiff executed to the defendant a lease, for the term of seven years, upon certain described property. The lease contained a clause to the effect that at any time during the term the defendant, at its option, might purchase of the plaintiff the leased premises for the price of twelve thousand five hundred dollars. In May, 1902, the defendant elected to buy the property in pursuance of the option. The deed in controversy was executed in compliance with the obligation to convey, which, by the exercise of the option, became operative and binding upon the plaintiff. There is no pretense on the part of the defendant that there was any new or additional agreement or modification of the old agreement, whereby the plaintiff became bound to convey any other property, or greater quantity of land, than was embraced in the option.\\nThe claim of the defendant is that there was no mistake; that the option covered the entire tract of land, including that reserved or excepted from the description in the lease, and that it was therefore in precise accord with the intention of the parties and that it was necessary, in order to comply with the option agreement, that the space of ground reserved from the operation of the lease should be conveyed to the defendant upon the exercise of the option; and that the exception, or reservation, which constituted part of the description in the lease, was purposely and properly omitted from the deed. Unless this construction of the option contract is correct, there can be no doubt that there was a mistake, and that the evidence amply supports the findings and judgment.\\nWe are of the, opinion that the option cannot be so construed.\\nThe description of the land leased is as follows: ‘ ‘ Situate at Redondo Beach in the county of Los Angeles, state of California, and being a portion of the property known as and called the ‘Pacific Salt Works Tract, ’ a portion of said tract hereby leased being more specifically delineated and described upon the blue print hereunto attached and made a part hereof, the said leased premises being inclosed in red lines upon said annexed blue print and consisting of two parcels, the larger of which contains, as shown upon said blue print, 17.07 acres of land and the smaller of said parcels, as shown upon said blue print, containing 2.31 acres of land; saving and reserving from the said leased premises that portion thereof lying between the tracks of the Los Angeles & Redondo Railway Company, as shown on said blue print, and also saving and reserving a strip of land twenty feet in width, being ten feet on either side of the center line of said railroad tracks as the same are now constructed, excepting, however, such portion of said twenty-foot strip so reserved as is at the date of this indenture occupied by the building or vats of the said lessee.”\\nThe option clause, so far as material, is in these words: “It is further agreed that at any time during the existence of this lease the said lessee . . . shall have, and it is hereby granted an option to purchase the said leased premises, at the price of $12,500 to be paid in gold coin of the United States at the date of the conveyance of said real property unto said lessee by said lessor.” (The italics in both clauses are our own.)\\nThe claim of the defendant that the term “leased premises,” in the option clause, was therein used in the same inaccurate sense which appears to have been given to it where it is used in the reservation clause in the description, and, consequently, that the option covered the entire area inclosed in the red lines, including the railroad tracks, is shown to be untenable by the context, the surrounding circumstances, and the conduct of the parties, as well as by the natural meaning of the words. Conditions in the lease require the lessee to “maintain on said leased premises” the present salt plant, and also require of the lessee a certain method of operation of the “leased premises,” and provide that upon a breach of the conditions the lessor may resume possession of the “leased premises.” In each of these instances the phrase does not embrace the excepted area. The lessee did not take possession of the railroad tracks, and claimed no right to do so until long after the execution of the deed in question, and the lessor operated the tracks continuously during the whole of the intervening period. The short section of the tracks included within the red lines was but a small part, in length, of the spur tracks of the plaintiff, and was absolutely necessary to the use of the part extending beyond these lines, and which would be cut off from connection with plaintiff’s main line if plaintiff were prevented from crossing the land with its cars. Its traffic over these spur tracks was important and valuable. The short pieces of track within the red lines would be of no substantial value to the defendant. The saving clause in the description is not a reservation of an easement' merely over a part of the leased premises. Its effect is to save and except from the operation of the lease the fee of the area between the tracks and for ten feet on each side of the center thereof, and hence the lease did not transfer any estate in that part of the space inclosed in the red lines. That space formed no part of the leased premises, and was not covered by the option clause giving the right to purchase the premises actually leased. (Sears v. Ackerman, 138 Cal. 586, [72 Pac. 171]; Butler v. Gosling, 130 Cal. 422, [62 Pac. 596].)\\nThere is therefore no foundation for the defendant’s contention that the evidence is insufficient to prove a mistake in the preparation and execution of the deed. It is not important to determine whether it was a mutual mistake or a mistake of plaintiff alone, known or suspected by the defendant. The complaint was in two counts, and alleged the mistake in both forms. If either was proven the plaintiff was entitled to the relief given.\\nThere is no merit in the objection that the mistake was due to the forgetfulness of the attorneys and officers of the plaintiff who drew and executed the deed, or by their neglect in failing to compare the description in the deed as prepared with that in the lease.\\nThe course of decision in this state has not been entirely consistent on the general subject of the effect of neglect as a reason for refusing relief in equity. The decisions in Hawkins v. Hawkins, 50 Cal. 558; Senter v. Senter, 70 Cal. 619, [11 Pac. 782]; Metropolitan L. A. v. Esche, 75 Cal. 513, [17 Pac. 675]; and Crane v. McCormick, 92 Cal. 181, [28 Pac. 222], are cited by defendant as authority for the proposition that a written contract will not be reformed in equity on the ground of mistake, at the instance of a party who neglected to read the instrument, when he had a full opportunity. to do so before its execution, and the defect is of such a character that he could easily have discovered it if he had read it with attention. The cases do not sustain the proposition to the full extent necessary to its application to the present case, although some expressions might seem to go so far as that. Hawkins v. Hawkins was criticised and explained in Wilson v. Moriarity, 88 Cal. 213, [26 Pac. 85]. It was not technically a suit to correct a mistake in the written contract, for the sale of the grain in question. It was an action to cancel the writing and to recover a balance due on the alleged previous verbal contract of sale. The preliminary statement of facts made by the reporter, if correct, would seem to make a clear case of mistake of one party known to the other, in which case, under the principles stated in sections 3399 and 3402 of the Civil Code, the plaintiff might have had the written contract corrected, and might have recovered the balance that would be due according to its terms as revised. Such relief was not asked, and the opinion, which is very general in its terms, seems to treat the cause of action as one founded upon alleged fraud, and applies the principle that, before entering into a contract, one must use the opportunities open to him to discover the facts áffeeting it, and if he negligently fails to do so, he cannot obtain relief from the fraud which by his neglect he suffered to be practiced upon him. It does not hold that the failure to read a contract with sufficient care to perceive a mistake in its terms, will of itself prevent relief by way of a correction of the mistake. In Senter v. Senter the mistake as to the description of the land was induced by false statements of the defendant to plaintiff concerning the same, and it was held that the plaintiff was entitled to have the correction made. Hawkins v. Hawkins is cited, and is declared to be not in point. In Metropolitan L. A. v. Esche, the alleged mistake was made by sureties in a bond for the performance by the principal of certain duties to the obligee during a term of office. The obligee was not aware of any mistake on the part of the sureties, and accepted the bond and allowed the principal to continue in its service upon the faith of it. There was therefore neither mistake nor fraud of which the sureties could complain. Crane v. McCormick was a similar case, but the facts were declared not to make out a ease of mutual mistake.\\nIt has been frequently decided that the mere failure of a party to read an instrument with sufficient attention to perceive an error or defect in its contents will not prevent its reformation at the instance of the party who executes it thus carelessly. In Higgins v. Parsons, 65 Cal. 280, [3 Pac. 881], the plaintiff signed a contract believing that it contained a certain stipulation agreed on. The defendant knew that it did not contain the stipulation, and also knew that the plaintiff believed that it did. The plaintiff had an opportunity to read the contract before signing. It is said that the conditions on which a contract may be reformed are specified in section 3399 of the Civil Code, and that, as that ' section does not authorize the refusal of such relief because the party asking it might have discovered the mistake before signing, the court is not at liberty to exact such diligence as a condition. Perhaps the court there should have added that the carelessness did not constitute a neglect of legal duty, within the meaning of section 1577 of the Civil Code. In Wilson v. Moriarity, 88 Cal. 213, [26 Pac. 85], it was held that the neglect of the plaintiff, when the lease was read to her by the notary, to pay sufficient attention to discover that it was for ten years, instead of five years, as she supposed, was not sufficient to defeat her action for its reformation in that particular. In Sullivan v. Moorhead, 99 Cal. 159, [33 Pac. 796], the deed was executed in compliance with a previous contract of sale, and in that respect it was similar to the case at bar. The contract was for the sale of lots 10, 11, 12, and 13 in a certain block. The deed described the land as lots 10, 11, 12, and “a part of 13.” The plaintiff read the deed, but did not observe the variance. The court said: “The fact of his having read the instrument would not prevent the court from finding that it was made under a mistake.” There are many authorities from other states to the effect that a written contract will be corrected in equity, although the mistake was patent on the face of the document, and could have been discovered if read with attention. (Albany C. S. I. v. Burdick, 87 N. Y. 46; Story v. Gammell, 68 Neb. 709, [94 N. W. 982]; Andrews v. Gillespie, 47 N. Y. 487; San Antonio v. McLane, 96 Tex. 48, [70 S. W. 201] ; Kelley v. Ward, 94 Tex. 289, [60 S. W. 311]; Loyd v. Phillips, 123 Wis. 627, [101 N. W. 1092] ; Taylor v. Glen Falls I. Co., 44 Fla. 273, [32 South. 887] ; Kilmer v. Smith, 77 N. Y. 226, [33 Am. Rep. 613] ; Snyder v. Ives, 42 Iowa, 162.)\\nThere was, it is true, some negligence on the part of the plaintiff in the case at bar. But it was an inadvertence of a character which will sometimes occur in the conduct of men of prudence and caution. The plat and lease were sent to an abstract company by plaintiff’s attorney with instructions to prepare a certificate of title and also a description for insertion in the deed. This was done, and the description, written on a slip of paper, was returned to the attorney, but in some way not explained the exception mentioned in the lease was not inserted therein. It was copied into the deed by the typewriter in this erroneous form. The attention of all the parties was particularly directed to other features of the transaction and to other parts of the description, the omission of the exception clause was not observed by any of them, and all signed the deed believing that the description therein was the same as in the lease. The negligence was not so gross as to constitute a neglect of legal duty, or forfeit the right of either party aggrieved to relief from the mistake.\\nThe judgment and order denying a new trial are affirmed.\\nAngellotti, J., and Sloss, J., concurred.\", 'type': 'majority', 'author': 'SHAW, J.'}]\n",
